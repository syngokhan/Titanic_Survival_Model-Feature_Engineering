# Titanic_Survival_Model-Feature_Engineering

# Business Problem
 
**Can you predict the probability of people surviving given their characteristics?**

# Dataset Story
**The data set contains information about the people involved in the Titanic shipwreck.**

**This dataset with a competition for entry level on Kaggle;**
**It consists of 768 observations and 12 variables.**

**The target variable is specified as "Survived";**

**Survival of 1 person,**

**0 indicates the death of the person.*

# Variables

**Survived – Survival**
**--1 Survived,**
**--0 Failed**

**Pclass – Ticket Class**
**--1 = Grade 1, 2 = Grade 2, 3 = Grade 3**

**Sex – Gender**

**Age – Age**

**Sibsp – Number of siblings / spouses on Titanic**

**Parch – Number of parents/children on Titanic**

**Embarked: – Port of embarkation**
**--(C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton**

**Fare – Ticket price**

**Cabin: Cabin number**

# Mission

**Develop a titanic survival model using data preprocessing and feature engineering methods.**
